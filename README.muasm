The MuAsm Assembler is really a very simple assembler. Its actually smaller
than the virtual machine itself and has a LOT of restrictions. But it
simplyfies the Testing of the Machine.

The advantage of the current implementation is, that you don't have to change
the assembler if you add new instrctions. Simply recompile it and it's ready.
