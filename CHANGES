V0.12
	* Operand buffer is now a pointer, to avoid the copying.
	* New OPCODES:
		Modulo
		Operations which make use of OP_CMP
	* Corrected a bug in OP_CMP (wrong cast)

V0.13
	* Removed bug in usage() in muasm.c
	* Added version number output in usage()
	* Removed a bug in the label/constant search routine (get_labeladdr)
	* Added the functionality for using EQUs
	* Added the getchar() Icall.
	* Fixed a bug in op_ret. (Return address was not cheked.)

V0.14
	* Finally, the big switches for the OP-Codes and the ICALLS have been
	  replaced by function pointers. It sounds silly, but one of the intentions
	  to write the interpreter was to try out function pointers (because
	  they are rarely needed).
	* For op_noop a function has been inserted to be consistent with the
	  other OP-Codes.
	* Added a #define for successful OP-Code termination (OPC_OK)
	* Changed the output when verbose is true.
	* Added handling for Div by zero.
V0.14a
	* GPL License notes inserted into source.
	* Insert the vim:ts=3:sw=3 statements into all source files.
	* Make it ready for uploading to sourveforge.net.

vim:ts=3:sw=3
